**HORSE RACE PREDICTION**

1. **Introduction**:
 
   This project aims to predict horse racing outcomes using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes detailed information on horse races and individual horses from 2014 to 2017.
   Given the complexity and inherent unpredictability of horse racing, this project seeks to explore various machine learning models and feature engineering techniques to improve prediction accuracy.

2. **Dataset Description**:
   
   The dataset consists of two main types of files: races and horses, each available for every year from 2014 to 2017.

   -finishing_position   :  The rank of the horse. (E.g. the horse with finishing_position 1 is the first to finish).
  
   -horse_number         :  The number for the horse in the specific race. (Note that the same horse may have different numbers in different races).
  
   -horse_name           :  English name of the horse.
  
   -horse_id             :  ID of the horse. (The ID for a horse is unique in all the races).
  
   -jockey               :  The one who rides the horse in the race. (A jockey can ride different horses in the races).
  
   -trainer              :  The one who trains the horse. (Multiple horses from a trainer can appear in the same race).
  
   -actual_weight        :  The extra weight that a horse carries in the race. (The horses with better performances in the previous races will carry extra weights to make the race more competitive)
  
   -declared_horse_weight:  The weight of the horse on date of the race.
  
   -draw                 :  The position of the horse at the starting point. The inner positions are usually advantageous and correspond to smaller draw numbers.
  
   -length_behind_winner :  The length behind the winner at the finish line. The unit is “horse length”.
  
   -running_position_i   :  The rank of the horse at the i-th timing point. (The running position will be “NA” if the total distance of the race is short and the horses do not cross the particular timing point)
  
   -finish_time          :  The total time from the starting point to the finish line. The unit is in seconds.
  
   -win_odds             :  The multiplier of the amount you bet to be received if you win. THe odds are usually determined automatically by the total money bet on each horse.
  
   -race_id              :  The ID of the race for this entry. The race_id is consistent in the two data files.
  
   -race_distance        :  The race distance in metres for each race.

3. **Project Goals**:
   
   Primary Goal   :

                    To predict the outcome of horse races (e.g., win or place).
   
   Secondary Goals:

                    To identify significant features affecting race outcomes.
   
                    To explore the imbalanced nature of the dataset and develop techniques to handle it.
   
                    To create a robust prediction model using historical data.

5. **Data Preprocessing**:
   
   Data Cleaning       :

                         Handle missing values.
   
                         Normalize data where necessary (e.g., times, distances).
   
                         Convert categorical variables to numerical representations (e.g., encoding country codes, race conditions).
   
   Feature Engineering :

                         Create new features based on existing data (e.g., performance metrics from past races).
   
                         Aggregate features across multiple races to capture trends.
   
   Data Integration    :

                         Merge race and horse datasets on rid to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

7. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   
   Descriptive Statistics :

                             Summary statistics of key features.
   
                             Distribution plots of continuous variables.
   
   Correlation Analysis   :

                             Correlation matrix to identify relationships between features.
   
                             Feature importance analysis using mutual information and other techniques.

   Visualization          :

                             Scatter plots, histograms, and box plots to visualize data distribution.
   
                             Heatmaps for correlation visualization.
9. **Modeling Approach**:
    
   Model Selection         :

                              Evaluate various machine learning models (e.g.,Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
   
                              Use cross-validation to assess model performance.
   
   Handling Imbalanced Data:

                              Use techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), under-sampling, and class weight adjustments.
   
   Feature Selection       :

                              Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).
   
                              Regularization techniques to reduce model complexity and prevent overfitting.
   
   Hyperparameter Tuning   :

                              Grid search and random search for optimal hyperparameters.

11. **Conclusion**:
    
      This project seeks to make predictions on the outcome of horse races through both classification and regression models.

      -For classification models, we aim to predict the winner and top 3 positions of a race.
   
      -For regression models, we aim to predict the finish time of the horses, hereby predicting the winner of the race.
   
      With the prediction results, we will make bets using different strategies to profit from the horse race.
      Backtesting results of each model will also show the number of bets and profit made from each strategy.
